# Configurator Example

Minimal example of reusing the [Token Configurator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/configurator)

Uses [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/) for local development and a simple [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) config for creating a bundle to deploy.

I also tried to add an example for Vite, but [Vite does not support WebAssembly bindings](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/4551), unfortunately.
